# Suprav Portfolio Starter (No-framework)

This is a simple, high-impact personal website starter designed to wow recruiters *without* heavy tooling.

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

For a local server (recommended):
- VS Code → install **Live Server**
- Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**

## Deploy (fastest)
### Option A: GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo named `yourname.github.io`
2. Upload these files to the repo root
3. Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / root
4. Your site becomes: `https://yourname.github.io`

### Option B: Netlify / Vercel
- Drag-and-drop the folder into Netlify, or import the repo in Vercel.

## Customize checklist
- Replace:
  - Email / GitHub / LinkedIn links (in the Contact section)
  - Project links (demo / github / build log)
  - `assets/RESUME_PLACEHOLDER.pdf` with your actual resume PDF
- Add:
  - 1–3 photos (build shots) in `assets/`
  - A 20–40s demo video for your best project

## Optional upgrades
- Add a `/projects/` folder with one HTML page per project
- Swap the zig-zag demo for your real project video + annotated screenshots
